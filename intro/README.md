This colaboratory (colab) will help you get prepared for the tutorials (practical sessions) at EEML 2020:

* Supervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning
* Unsupervised Learning

Here you will get familiar with the environment and tools used in the tutorials. **We strongly encourage you to go through this tutorial before the school**. There are small exercises throughout the sections to help you internalize the topics covered and to check your understanding. Finally, there is also a comprehensive exercise where you use all these tools to train an mnist digit classifier. **The other lab sessions will assume you can do this**.

_Special thanks to the authors of educational material at DeepMind, as their work was a great resource for the creation of this lab_.
